### What I learned

I have been using SASS variables in other projects, I just discovered that you can assign variables in vanilla
CSS and that's nice when your dealing with colors. I also used [Pixel Perfect
Pro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-perfect-pro/) to be as close as possible to original
design.
